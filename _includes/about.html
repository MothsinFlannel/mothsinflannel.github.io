        <h3>"Who are you?"</h3>
        <p>Heya! My name is James! Due to the vast variety of responsibilities at my recent jobs, I've become a generalist in the world of Information Technology with a natural inclination for scripting and code.</p>

        <h3>"What's this site for?"</h3>
        <p>I'm ready to take the next step in my career! I've reached a comfortable level of income for my lifestyle, so my next step is less about financial growth and more about finding work that fits my personal preferences and natural work style. This is just a quick static portfolio site to show off things I've worked on.</p>

        <h3>"What are you looking for next in your career?"</h3>
        <p>To be more specific, I've found that I'm consistently motivated to engage in creative problem solving through programming. With this insight, I want to find work that lets me specialize in this kind of work instead of being spread thin across many skills.</p>
        <p>Additionally, I'm looking for a remote job so that I can have a greater degree of control over my work enviornment. This control over my space has proven to boost both my productivity and satisfaction, so it's a win for me and my employer!</p>
